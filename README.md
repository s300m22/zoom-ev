## Hygen - Creating React Elements

Hygen is the dev tool that provides the ability for generating scalable code. All project templates are defined in the `__template` directory.
For more details check [Hygen docs](https://www.hygen.io/docs/quick-start/).
Instead of creating manually new React elements just run `hygen:element` which will Lead You to a faster starting point in creating new elements.
