# Project security standards

This document describes all security standards and good practices that should be implemented and preserved when developing IT project. All listed goals are compulsory to achieve ( unless explicitly stated otherwise ), and their results should be described in detail. For those goals that do not apply to the project, or were skipped on purpose, or were not implemented in favour of different solution, it is mandatory to explain the reason of such decision in "Achieved result" section.

Main purpose of this document is to gather all security-related information in the project, as well as document all steps taken to adhere to company security policy

Each change in the content of this document should be reported in "Changelog" table
